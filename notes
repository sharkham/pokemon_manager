Pokémon App
[X] need different view for a user's Pokémon that is user/something and goes in user controller
[] need error handling
[] add all the links
[] there is currently a line break only after h2 and I need it even if there's no h2

- should logged in users be able to view Pokémon?
- need to lock numbers and types into species
- might need a "pokemon species" table to let people select from to make this work better
